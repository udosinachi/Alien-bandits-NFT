              150 light-years away, in an experimental planet created by Elun
              Mosk [sic] called Hazron, a magnificent specie of specially bred
              monkeys needed absolutely nothing to survive other than haze and
              chilled vibes. On a planet, where everything was dope and ganga,
              there was every single specie of haze you can think of on Hazron.
              What`'`s most fascinating is the diverse forms of which the haze
              took, they even existed in form of tall palm trees and beautiful
              swines.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the heart of Hazron stood the eternal kush, a plant which was
              the sole source of eternal happiness and balance in all of the
              universe. This made the monkeys live in perfect peace, harmony and
              balance for millenia. World peace, which has been an impossible
              task to achieve for thousands of years by humanity has literally
              been in Hazron since day one, and the only reason was the Eternal
              kush and of course haze. Everything changed when an advanced
              civilization of humanoids attacked, destroying their planet and
              wiping almost 99% of their global population in search of the
              Eternal kush
            </p>
            <p>
              The very last surviving species of haze monkeys face an ultimate
              challenge of saving their species and rebuilding their planet,
              while also fighting off an unassailable enemy. They receive
              support from a twin specie from an alternate universe but will the
              OG monkeys succeed in saving their planet and restoring Hazron?
              find out in our project lineup!
